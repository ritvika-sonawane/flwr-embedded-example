2025-04-06 17:00:55,386 - INFO - Starting Flower server with arguments: Namespace(server_address='0.0.0.0:8080', rounds=3, sample_fraction=0.2, min_num_clients=10)
2025-04-06 17:00:55,386 - WARNING - 
Setting `min_available_clients` lower than `min_fit_clients` or
`min_evaluate_clients` can cause the server to fail when there are too few clients
connected to the server. `min_available_clients` must be set to a value larger
than or equal to the values of `min_fit_clients` and `min_evaluate_clients`.

2025-04-06 17:00:55,386 - WARNING - DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.server.start_server() is deprecated.
	Instead, use the `flower-superlink` CLI command to start a SuperLink as shown below:

		$ flower-superlink --insecure

	To view usage and all available options, run:

		$ flower-superlink --help

	Using `start_server()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
